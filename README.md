# Fluxify React (Vite) - Component-based

## How to run

1. Install dependencies:

   cd fluxify-react

## Notes
- This project was auto-generated from your HTML file and split into components:
  - src/components/{Navbar,Hero,Services,About,Portfolio,Contact,Footer}.jsx
- Tailwind CSS is configured (tailwind.config.cjs & postcss.config.cjs).
- Replace `src/assets/logo.png` with your real logo image.
- Some scripts (element SDK) were not included — you can re-add SDK initialization in App.jsx if needed.
